# Landslide Susceptibility Mapping and Exposure Assessment

## Project Overview
Welcome to the project on **Landslide Susceptibility Mapping and Exposure Assessment**, conducted as part of the Master of Science in Geoinformatics at Politecnico di Milano. This project aims to assess and visualize the risk of landslides in a specific region using advanced geospatial technologies and data analysis techniques.

## Description
This project utilizes Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies to integrate various datasets such as Digital Terrain Model (DTM), land use data (DUSAF), river and road buffers, landslide inventory maps, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). These datasets help in understanding the terrain, land cover, proximity to water bodies and infrastructure, historical landslide events, and vegetation health. The final output includes a WebGIS application that provides an interactive platform for exploring the susceptibility map and related data layers.

## Study Area
The study area is situated in the Lombardy region, within the province of Bergamo, Italy, covering approximately 56 square kilometers and hosting a population of 12,109 residents. The area includes the towns of Cerete, Songavazzo, Fino del Monte, and portions of Rovetta and Sovere.

## Workflow
The project workflow is divided into six main steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant datasets such as DTM, DUSAF, NDVI, river and road buffers, and landslide inventory.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Reprojecting, clipping, and rasterizing datasets to ensure uniformity and focus on the study area.
3. **Susceptibility Modeling:** Developing a model to predict landslide susceptibility based on the preprocessed datasets.
4. **Validation:** Validating the model using historical landslide data and statistical methods.
5. **Exposure Assessment:** Analyzing the exposure of populations within the susceptible areas.
6. **WebGIS Development:** Creating an interactive WebGIS application to visualize the results.
